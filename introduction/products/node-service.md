# âš™ Fullnode Service

ChainUp Cloud provides fullnode services so that you do not have to spend engineering time maintaining and managing nodes yourself. This allows you to focus on building your product rather than having to worry about infrastructure maintenance.

Running your own nodes can be very expensive from storage to bandwidth to valuable engineering time. Things like spinning up more nodes when scaling, upgrading nodes to the latest versions, and ensuring state consistency, can distract from building and spending resources on your desired Web3 product.
