The ChainNova NFT collection, released in December, has gained significant popularity in the market. This project, led by the ChainUp cloud developer community, is designed to celebrate Christmas and build community engagement. During the pre-launch phase, whitelisted users have the opportunity to mint NFTs for free, while the public sale offers non-whitelisted users a chance to purchase NFTs for 0.001 ETH (approximately 2 USD). The creative concept revolves around a blank box symbolizing infinite possibilities, and each NFT features unique expressions and decorations following the theme "The Box of Infinite Possibilities." Holders of ChainNova NFTs will receive priority access to future benefits within the ChainUp cloud developer community.
