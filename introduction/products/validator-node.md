# ðŸ‘¥ White Label Validator

ChainUp Cloud provide validator nodes as a service. Forget about hardware specs, setup, node maintenance and upgrades. Validators do not need any deep technical knowledge to operate. You just need to upload your own signing credentials, and allow ChainUp Cloud to run a non-custodial validator on your behalf. ChainUp Cloud's White Label Validator is designed for the most sophisticated exchanges, custodians, and institutional investors.

### Security & Customizability

To enterprises, security is of maximum importance. ChainUp Cloud validator nodes do not own the withdrawal keys and only controls the validator signing keys. Funds can only be withdrawn by the enterprises themselves.&#x20;

The validator nodes are also customizable to fit the needs of various business use cases through a simple UI. There is no need for setup, node maintenance and upgrades, we will handle it.

### Maximum Value Extraction

Our validator nodes comes with Maximum Value Extraction to boost validator rewards to the utmost amount.&#x20;

To do so, we utilize cutting edge technologies like MEV-boost (For Ethereum), MEV-Bor (For Polygon), Jito (For Solana) and many more. We are also continuously developing our own in-house MEV software for other blockchains to maximize validator rewards.
