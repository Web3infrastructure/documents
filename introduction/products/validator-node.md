# ðŸ‘¥ Validator Node

ChainUp Cloud provide validator nodes as a service. Forget about hardware specs, setup, node maintenance and upgrades. Validators do not need any deep technical knowledge to operate. You just need to upload your own signing credentials, and allow ChainUp Cloud to run a non-custodial validator on your behalf.
