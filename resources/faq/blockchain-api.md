# ⛓ Blockchain API

## :gear:General

### What is a Blockchain API?

A Blockchain API provides easy access to Web3 networks, empowering developers to create decentralized applications and enhance efficiency using reliable infrastructure.

### Why should I use ChainUp Cloud's Blockchain API?

Interfacing with a blockchain node is expensive and time consuming. Also, you need to pay extra attention to communicated with a trusted node. ChainUp Cloud's API is free, reliable and trustworthy.

### What blockchains are available on ChainUp Cloud?

We now support Ethereum, Filecoin, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Polkadot, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Aptos, Sui, Starknet, Harmony, Fantom, Avalanche, Solana, Near, Tron and more. More chains coming soon.

### What is the difference between API and RPC endpoint?

We call any programmable interface an API (Application Programming Interface). It is a general concept. For Web3 development, we have JSON RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) as the interface for the block chain calls. Almost all the APIs we provide are RPC endpoints. Just be consistent when you discuss the topic with others.&#x20;

### What is an API key?

An API Key is the credential to query all services. When you create an App in your dashboard, an API key will be generated with your ChainUp Cloud App. Please note, you should never share your API key to others to prevent others from using your account.&#x20;
