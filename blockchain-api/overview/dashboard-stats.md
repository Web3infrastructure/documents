# Dashboard stats

The dashboard shows the generic API usage stats such as the number of calls made, the average response time, and the success rate of those calls. It may also display information about the devices or programs that are making the API calls, as well as the specific endpoints or functions that are being accessed. This information can be useful for developers and administrators who want to monitor the performance and usage of their API.
