# Solana Nodes FAQ

**What is the role of a validator in the Solana network?**\
Validators are nodes that participate in the consensus process by confirming transactions and producing new blocks. They are crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the blockchain.

**How does Solana achieve high throughput?**\
Solana utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH) combined with a version of Proof of Stake (PoS). This allows the network to process thousands of transactions per second.

**What are the minimum requirements to run a Solana node?**\
To run a Solana node, you typically need a powerful computer or server with a multi-core CPU, at least 16 GB of RAM, and a fast SSD for storage. Additionally, a stable internet connection is essential.

**Can I run a Solana node on a virtual machine?**\
Yes, you can run a Solana node on a virtual machine, but ensure that the VM meets the necessary hardware specifications to handle the load effectively.

**What programming languages can I use to interact with the Solana blockchain?**\
You can interact with the Solana blockchain using various programming languages, including JavaScript, Rust, and Python. The Solana SDKs provide libraries for these languages.

**How do I stake my SOL tokens?**\
To stake SOL tokens, you need to choose a validator, delegate your tokens to them via a wallet that supports staking, and follow the staking process outlined in the wallet’s interface.

**What is the difference between a full node and a light node?**\
A full node keeps a complete copy of the blockchain, while a light node only stores a subset of the blockchain data. Light nodes rely on full nodes for transaction verification and data retrieval.

**What is a Solana wallet?**\
A Solana wallet is a software application that allows users to store, send, and receive SOL tokens and other assets on the Solana blockchain. Examples include Phantom, Sollet, and Solflare.

**How can I monitor the performance of my Solana node?**\
You can monitor your node’s performance using various tools such as Grafana, which can visualize metrics like CPU usage, memory, and network traffic. Solana also provides built-in telemetry for monitoring.

**What are some common use cases for Solana?**\
Solana is used for various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming applications, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
