# ðŸ’Ž Ethereum Beacon

The Ethereum beacon chain is a core component of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. It is a new proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that will eventually replace the current proof-of-work (PoW) Ethereum blockchain. The beacon chain is responsible for managing the overall operation of the Ethereum 2.0 network, including managing the validator set and the consensus mechanism.

In this section, you will be able to learn about what makes Ethereum special and how you can leverage available tools to build amazing products!

You can then get started with the available RPC & REST APIs we support [**via ChainUp Cloud**.](https://cloud.chainup.com/)

Last but not least, if you are looking for guidelines or simply some inspiration, check out available tutorials in [**For Developers**](../../introduction/for-developers/use-blockchain-api.md).

Be sure to check out the [**official Ethereum documentation**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/).
