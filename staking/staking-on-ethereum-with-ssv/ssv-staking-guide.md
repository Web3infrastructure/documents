3.  You need to choose the cluster of network operators for running your validator. Within this cluster, the operator's annual fee is visible, and it is set at 4 SSV.&#x20;



    You have the flexibility to choose a network operator based on three key factors:

    1. The number of validators associated with the operator.
    2. The operator's highest 30-day performance percentage.
    3.  The yearly fee charged by the operator.\
