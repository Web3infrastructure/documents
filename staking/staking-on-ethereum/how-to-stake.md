# â›² How to stake Ethereum?

A short guide to set up staking on Ethereum with [**ChainUp Cloud**](https://cloud.chainup.com/).

### **Prerequisites**

**a.** A compatible wallet (currently only supports [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/)) that holds more than 32 Eth

**b.** Generate `deposit_data-timestamp.json` which can be done through the [**deposit-cli tool**](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases/).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Specifically, what we actually need is the `withdrawal_credentials` within the `deposit_data-timestamp.json`
{% endhint %}



### 1. Uploading `deposit_data`/`withdrawal_credentials`

**Step 1:** Click on **Ethereum 2** (sidebar). Make sure, you are in the **Ethereum2** subpage, and click on the **Add Validator Button**.
