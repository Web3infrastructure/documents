3. Choose the express staking option. \
   The ChainUp Cloud platform automatically creates a special account for you called a validator account and  a key pair, which is a set of two keys, a private key and a public key. The private key is used to sign transactions, and the public key is used to verify signatures.

4.  You need to choose the cluster of network operators for running your validator. Within this cluster, the operator's annual fee is visible, and it is set at 5 SSV.&#x20;



    You have the flexibility to choose a network operator based on three key factors:

    1. The number of validators associated with the operator.
    2. The operator's highest 30-day performance percentage.
    3. The yearly fee charged by the operator.

8.  Once your deposit is confirmed, you will become a validator on the Ethereum 2.0 network. Your node will start participating in the validation process. As a validator, you will earn rewards for successfully validating transactions and securing the network. These rewards will be paid in ETH.
