4. Once the SSV node is running successfully, the operator must register it with the SSV smart contract to ensure it can be discovered and recognized by validators.

5. To proceed, set an operator fee. This fee will be charged to validators who choose you as one of their operators.

7.  &#x20;Two features of the platform are as follows:

    A. Withdraw: The Operator has the ability to withdraw their cumulative income. However, to start earning, the validator needs to run for a specific period of time as per the platform's requirements.

    B. Edit Operator Name: The platform allows for the change of the operator's name.\
