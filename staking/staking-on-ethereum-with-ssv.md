  SSV is a new way to stake Ethereum that is more decentralized and secure than
  traditional staking. It does this by dividing a validator's keys across
  multiple nodes, making it much more difficult for

# üìè Staking on Ethereum with SSV

Once you have started staking, your SSV node will start participating in the Ethereum consensus process and you will start earning rewards.\


1.  Once logged in Chainup Cloud. [Sign up an account with this guide](https://docs.chainupcloud.com/introduction/for-investors/run-your-own-validators#1.-creating-an-account).  Locate the "Ethereum" dropdown menu, and then select the option labeled "SSV Validator."\

2. To get started, please connect your MetaMask wallet. Once your wallet is connected, you will need to select the "Add a Cluster" option. This will allow you to configure and connect to a specific cluster.

3.  Validators are managed by clusters, which consist of selected operators managing them.\
    \
    You need to choose the cluster of network operators for running your validator. Within this cluster, the operator's annual fee is visible, and it is set at 4 SSV. &#x20;



    You have the flexibility to choose a network operator based on three key factors:

    1. The number of validators associated with the operator.
    2. The operator's highest 30-day performance percentage.
    3.  The yearly fee charged by the operator.\

4.  Review the Cluster Balances and fees (T\&C) carefully then select the confirm option. The longer the cluster can sustain and operate depends on the amount of SSV you deposit.

5.  Review your Cluster of selected operators. Then proceed to select the +Add Validator option to add a validator on SSV.network. \

You'll need to confirm your choice and transfer the necessary SSV balance to cover operational costs. &#x20;

Precaution: **Never** do an **online key splitting operation** on the **testnet** using a **private key** that is intended for use on the **mainnet**.
{% endhint %}

7.  Next, you will be required to upload the Validator key file (named keystore) and enter the password to decrypt it. If you do not have a validator key file, you may follow the [following how-to-create-validator-key guide](https://docs.chainupcloud.com/validator-node/ethereum/how-to-create-validator-keys). \

8. &#x20;After the network confirms the transaction, you'll see a summary screen of the validators clusters. This includes cluster balance, estimated runway (how long the cluster can sustain operational costs), and details about individual validators, such as their balance and status (active or inactive).
